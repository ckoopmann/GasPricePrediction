# Python
This directory  contains Python code to download the data and implement the models, and is structured into the following subdirectories and files:
* **Python/BinaryPrediction** contains the code for training, tuning and testing the models in the binary prediction problem
* **Python/LevelPrediction** contains the code for training, tuning and testing the models in the price level prediction problem
* **data_download.py** contains the code to automatically download data from the Thomson Reuters Eikon database
The correct execution of all of these files requires the Python working directory to be set to the directory in which the file is located.
