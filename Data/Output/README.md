#Data/Output
This directory  contains Python data generated when training and tuning the models, and is structured into the following subdirectories:
* **Data/Output/BinaryPrediction** contains the data generated by training, tuning and testing the models in the binary prediction problem
* **Data/Output/LevelPrediction** contains the data generated by training, tuning and testing the models in the price level prediction problem
For each tuning, variable selection and evaluation step the directories contain three csv files:
* **predictions.csv** contains the predictions from each model in each iteration and the actual as well as reference prediction by the non data-driven model (Lagged Value, Equal Distribution)
* **histories.csv** contains the error histories from the training of each model in each iteration
* **evaluation.csv** contains the value of the loss function on the test set for each model and iteration
