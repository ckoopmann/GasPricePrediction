	abstract = {Several variants of the Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) architecture for recurrent neural networks have been proposed since its inception in 1995. In recent years, these networks have become the state-of-the-art models for a variety of machine learning problems. This has led to a renewed interest in understanding the role and utility of various computational components of typical LSTM variants. In this paper, we present the first large-scale analysis of eight LSTM variants on three representative tasks: speech recognition, handwriting recognition, and polyphonic music modeling. The hyperparameters of all LSTM variants for each task were optimized separately using random search and their importance was assessed using the powerful fANOVA framework. In total, we summarize the results of 5400 experimental runs (about 15 years of CPU time), which makes our study the largest of its kind on LSTM networks. Our results show that none of the variants can improve upon the standard LSTM architecture significantly, and demonstrate the forget gate and the output activation function to be its most critical components. We further observe that the studied hyperparameters are virtually independent and derive guidelines for their efficient adjustment.},

	title = {A {Critical} {Review} of {Recurrent} {Neural} {Networks} for {Sequence} {Learning}},
	url = {http://arxiv.org/abs/1506.00019},
	abstract = {Countless learning tasks require dealing with sequential data. Image captioning, speech synthesis, and music generation all require that a model produce outputs that are sequences. In other domains, such as time series prediction, video analysis, and musical information retrieval, a model must learn from inputs that are sequences. Interactive tasks, such as translating natural language, engaging in dialogue, and controlling a robot, often demand both capabilities. Recurrent neural networks (RNNs) are connectionist models that capture the dynamics of sequences via cycles in the network of nodes. Unlike standard feedforward neural networks, recurrent networks retain a state that can represent information from an arbitrarily long context window. Although recurrent neural networks have traditionally been difficult to train, and often contain millions of parameters, recent advances in network architectures, optimization techniques, and parallel computation have enabled successful large-scale learning with them. In recent years, systems based on long short-term memory (LSTM) and bidirectional (BRNN) architectures have demonstrated ground-breaking performance on tasks as varied as image captioning, language translation, and handwriting recognition. In this survey, we review and synthesize the research that over the past three decades first yielded and then made practical these powerful learning models. When appropriate, we reconcile conflicting notation and nomenclature. Our goal is to provide a self-contained explication of the state of the art together with a historical perspective and references to primary research.},

ERNN is a time-varying predictive control system and is developed with the ability to keep memory of recent events in order to predict future output. The stochastic time effective function represents that the recent information has a stronger effect for the investors than the old information. With the established model the empirical research has a good performance in testing the predictive effects on four different time series indices. Compared to other models, the present model is possible to evaluate data from 1990s to today with extreme accuracy and speedy. The applied CID (complexity invariant distance) analysis and multiscale CID analysis, are provided as the new useful measures to evaluate a better predicting ability of the proposed model than other traditional models.},

Daubechies D1(Haar), D2 and D4 wavelet transforms are adopted, and the numerical results reveal that certain wavelet components can effectively be used to identify the SMP characteristics with relation to the system demand in electric power systems. The wavelet coefficients associated with certain frequency and time localization are adjusted using the conventional multiple regression method and then reconstructed in order to predict the SMP for the next scheduling day through a five scale synthesis technique. The outcome of the study clearly indicates that the proposed wavelet transform approach can be used as an attractive and effective means for SMP forecasting.},

	abstract = {Novel periodic extensions of dynamic long-memory regression models with autoregressive conditional heteroscedastic errors are considered for the analysis of daily electricity spot prices. The parameters of the model with mean and variance specifications are estimated simultaneously by the method of approximate maximum likelihood. The methods are implemented for time series of 1,200–4,400 daily price observations in four European power markets. Apart from persistence, heteroscedasticity, and extreme observations in prices, a novel empirical finding is the importance of day-of-the-week periodicity in the autocovariance function of electricity spot prices. In particular, the very persistent daily log prices from the Nord Pool power exchange of Norway are effectively modeled by our framework, which is also extended with explanatory variables to capture supply-and-demand effects. The daily log prices of the other three electricity markets—EEX in Germany, Powernext in France, and APX in The Netherlands—are less persistent, but periodicity is also highly significant. The dynamic behavior differs from market to market and depends primarily on the method of power generation: hydro power, power generated from fossil fuels, or nuclear power. The article improves on existing models in capturing the memory characteristics, which are important in derivative pricing and real option analysis.},

With the increasing popularity of regime switching and time-varying parameter models for predicting power prices, the multi model and evolutionary considerations that usually support the combining of simpler time series methods may be less applicable when the individual models incorporate these features. We address this question with a backtesting analysis on British day-ahead prices. Furthermore, given the volatility of power prices and concerns about accurate forecasting under extreme price excursions, we evaluate the results using various error metrics including expected shortfall. The comparisons are furthermore carefully simulated to consider model selection uncertainty in order to realistically test the value of combining as an ex ante policy. Overall, our results support combining for both accurate operational planning and risk management.},

	abstract = {Energy price forecasting in a competitive electricity market is crucial for the market participants in planning their operations and managing their risk, and it is also the key information in the economic optimization of the electric power industry. However, price series usually have a complex behavior due to their nonlinearity, nonstationarity, and time variancy. In this paper, a novel hybrid method to forecast day-ahead electricity price is proposed. This hybrid method is based on wavelet transform, Auto-Regressive Integrated Moving Average (ARIMA) models and Radial Basis Function Neural Networks (RBFN). The wavelet transform provides a set of better-behaved constitutive series than price series for prediction. ARIMA model is used to generate a linear forecast, and then RBFN is developed as a tool for nonlinear pattern recognition to correct the estimation error in wavelet-ARIMA forecast. Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) is used to optimize the network structure which makes the RBFN be adapted to the specified training set, reducing computation complexity and avoiding overfitting. The proposed method is examined on the electricity market of mainland Spain and the results are compared with some of the most recent price forecast methods. The results show that the proposed hybrid method could provide a considerable improvement for the forecasting accuracy.},

	abstract = {Electricity price forecasting in deregulated open power markets using neural networks is presented. Forecasting electricity price is a challenging task for on-line trading and e-commerce. Bidding competition is one of the main transaction approaches after deregulation. Forecasting the hourly market-clearing prices (MCP) in daily power markets is the most essential task and basis for any decision making in order to maximize the benefits. Artificial neural networks are found to be most suitable tool as they can map the complex interdependencies between electricity price, historical load and other factors. The neural network approach is used to predict the market behaviors based on the historical prices, quantities and other information to forecast the future prices and quantities. The basic idea is to use history and other estimated factors in the future to “fit” and “extrapolate” the prices and quantities. A neural network method to forecast the market-clearing prices (MCPs) for day-ahead energy markets is developed. The structure of the neural network is a three-layer back propagation (BP) network. The price forecasting results using the neural network model shows that the electricity price in the deregulated markets is dependent strongly on the trend in load demand and clearing price.},

These electricity price classifications are important because all market participants do not to know the exact value of future prices in their decision-making process. In this paper, classifications of electricity market prices with respect to pre-specified electricity price threshold are used. In this proposed approach, all time series (historical price series) are transformed from time domain to frequency domain using DCT. These discriminative spectral co-efficient forms the set of input features and are classified using NN. The price classification NN and the proposed DCT–NN were developed and compared to check the performance. The simulation results show that the proposed method provides a better and efficient method for day-ahead deregulated electricity market price classification.},

In this paper, a new forecast strategy is proposed for day ahead prediction of electricity price, which is a complex signal with nonlinear, volatile and time dependent behavior. Our forecast strategy includes a new two stage feature selection algorithm, a composite neural network (CNN) and a few auxiliary predictors. The feature selection algorithm has two filtering stages to remove irrelevant and redundant candidate inputs, respectively. This algorithm is based on mutual information (MI) criterion and selects the input variables of the CNN among a large set of candidate inputs. The CNN is composed of a few neural networks (NN) with a new data flow among its building blocks. The CNN is the forecast engine of the proposed strategy. A kind of cross-validation technique is also presented to fine-tune the adjustable parameters of the feature selection algorithm and CNN. Moreover, the proposed price forecast strategy is equipped with a few auxiliary predictors to enrich the candidate set of inputs of the forecast engine. The whole proposed strategy is examined on the PJM, Spanish and Californian electricity markets and compared with some of the most recent price forecast methods.},

However, the deregulation of electricity markets created a competitive environment and the introduction of new market participants, such as the retailers and aggregators, whose economic viability and profitability highly depends on the spot market price patterns. The aim of this study is to examine artificial neural network (ANN) based models for Day-ahead price forecasting. Specifically, the models refer to the sole application of ANNs or to hybrid models, where the ANN is combined with clustering algorithm. The training data are clustered in homogenous groups and for each cluster, a dedicated forecaster is employed. The proposed models are characterized by comprehensive operation and by high level of flexibility; different inputs can be taken under consideration and different ANN topologies can be examined. The models are tested on a data set that consists of atypical price patterns and many outliers. This approach makes the price forecasting problem a more challenging task, providing evidence that the proposed models can be considered as useful and robust forecasting tools to the actual needs of market participants, including the traditional generation companies and self-producers, but also the retailers/suppliers and aggregators.},

For this purpose, the original crude oil spot price series were first decomposed into a finite, and often small, number of intrinsic mode functions (IMFs). Then a three-layer feed-forward neural network (FNN) model was used to model each of the extracted IMFs, so that the tendencies of these IMFs could be accurately predicted. Finally, the prediction results of all IMFs are combined with an adaptive linear neural network (ALNN), to formulate an ensemble output for the original crude oil price series. For verification and testing, two main crude oil price series, West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude oil spot price and Brent crude oil spot price, are used to test the effectiveness of the proposed EMD-based neural network ensemble learning methodology. Empirical results obtained demonstrate attractiveness of the proposed EMD-based neural network ensemble learning paradigm.},

The proposed model follows the Heterogeneous Market Hypothesis that assumes the unstationarity and dynamic changing nature of the underlying market structure and introduces the wavelet analysis to analyze the dynamic underlying Data Generating Process at finer time scale domain. The simple averaging based ensemble model is introduced to reduce the estimation bias resulting from the use of different wavelet families by deriving market consensus view. The ensemble members are selected dynamically based on their in-sample performance among forecast matrices based on different wavelet families. Results from empirical studies show the superior performance of the proposed algorithm against the benchmark models, in terms of both level and directional predictive accuracy. The proposed model can effectively extract and model the time varying heterogeneous market microstructure, whose accurate characterization results in further improvement in market analysis and predictability.},

	abstract = {In oil markets, the crack spread refers to the crude–product price relationship. Refiners are major participants in oil markets and they are primarily exposed to the crack spread. In other words, refiner activity is substantially driven by the objective of protecting the crack spread. Moreover, oil consumers are active participants in the oil hedging market and they are frequently exposed to the crack spread. From another perspective, hedge funds are heavily using crack spread to speculate in oil markets. Based on the high volume of crack spread futures trading in oil markets, the question we want to raise is whether the crack spread futures can be a good predictor of oil price movements. We investigated first whether there is a causal relationship between the crack spread futures and the spot oil markets in a vector error correction framework. We found the causal impact of crack spread futures on spot oil market both in the long- and the short-run after April 2003 where we detected a structural break in the model. To examine the forecasting performance, we use the random walk model (RWM) as a benchmark, and we also evaluate the forecasting power of crack spread futures against the crude oil futures. The results showed that (a) both the crack spread futures and the crude oil futures outperformed the RWM; and (b) the crack spread futures are almost as good as the crude oil futures in predicting the movements in spot oil markets.},

	abstract = {We examine the usefulness of several ARIMA-GARCH models for modeling and forecasting the conditional mean and volatility of weekly crude oil spot prices in eleven international markets over the 1/2/1997–10/3/2009 period. In particular, we investigate the out-of-sample forecasting performance of four volatility models — GARCH, EGARCH and APARCH and FIGARCH over January 2009 to October 2009. Forecasting results are somewhat mixed, but in most cases, the APARCH model outperforms the others. Also, conditional standard deviation captures the volatility in oil returns better than the traditional conditional variance. Finally, shocks to conditional volatility dissipate at an exponential rate, which is consistent with the covariance-stationary GARCH models than the slow hyperbolic rate implied by the FIGARCH alternative.},

	abstract = {Oil price prediction has usually proved to be an intractable task due to the intrinsic complexity of oil market mechanism. In addition, the recent oil shock and its consequences relaunch the debate on understanding the behavior underlying the expected oil prices. Combining the dynamic properties of multilayer back propagation neural network and the recent Harr A trous wavelet decomposition, a Hybrid model HTW-MPNN is implemented to achieve prominent prediction of crude oil price. While recent studies focus on the determination of the best forecasting model by comparing various neural architectures or applying several decomposition techniques to the ANN, the new insight of this paper is to target the issue of the transfer function selection providing robust simulations on both in sample and out of sample basis. Based on the work of Yonaba, H., Anctil, F., and Fortin, V. (2010) “Comparing Sigmoid Transfer Functions for Neural Network Multistep Ahead Stream flow forecasting”. Journal of Hydrologic Engineering, April, 275–283, we use three variants of activation function namely sigmoid, bipolar sigmoid and hyperbolic tangent in order to test the model's flexibility. Furthermore, the forecasting robustness is checked through several levels of input–hidden nodes. Comparatively, results of HTW-MBPNN perform better than the conventional BPNN. Our conclusions add a major attribute to the previous studies corroborating the Occam razor's principle, especially when simulations are constructed through training and testing phases simultaneously. Finally, more eligible forecasting power is found according to the wavelet oil price signal which appears to be the closest to the real anticipations of future oil price fluctuations.},

This paper proposes a revised hybrid model built upon empirical mode decomposition (EMD) based on the feed-forward neural network (FNN) modeling framework incorporating the slope-based method (SBM), which is capable of capturing the complex dynamic of crude oil prices. Three commonly used multi-step-ahead prediction strategies proposed in the literature, including iterated strategy, direct strategy, and MIMO (multiple-input multiple-output) strategy, are examined and compared, and practical considerations for the selection of a prediction strategy for multi-step-ahead forecasting relating to crude oil prices are identified. The weekly data from the WTI (West Texas Intermediate) crude oil spot price are used to compare the performance of the alternative models under the EMD–SBM–FNN modeling framework with selected counterparts. The quantitative and comprehensive assessments are performed on the basis of prediction accuracy and computational cost. The results obtained in this study indicate that the proposed EMD–SBM–FNN model using the MIMO strategy is the best in terms of prediction accuracy with accredited computational load.},

In this study, a deep learning ensemble approach is proposed to deal with this problem. In our approach, two techniques are utilized. One is an advanced deep neural network model named stacked denoising autoencoders (SDAE) which is used to model the nonlinear and complex relationships of oil price with its factors. The other is a powerful ensemble method named bootstrap aggregation (bagging) which generates multiple data sets for training a set of base models (SDAEs). Our approach combines the merits of these two techniques and is especially suitable for oil price forecasting. In the empirical study, the WTI crude oil price series are investigated and 198 economic series are used as exogenous variables. Our approach is tested against some competing approaches and shows superior forecasting ability that is statistically proved by three tests.},

The following price forecasting techniques have been covered: (i) artificial neural network, (ii) support vector machine, (iii) wavelet, (iv) genetic algorithm, and (v) hybrid systems. In order to investigate the state of artificial intelligent models for oil price forecasting, thirty five research papers (published during 2001 to 2013) had been reviewed in form of table (for ease of comparison) based on the following parameters: (a) input variables, (b) input variables selection method, (c) data characteristics (d) forecasting accuracy and (e) model architecture. This review reveals procedure of AI methods used in complex oil price related studies.

	abstract = {In order to reduce their exposure to the erratic fluctuations of the financial markets, traders are nowadays increasingly dealing with options and other derivative securities instead of directly trading in the underlying assets. This paradigm shift has attracted the attention of many researchers, and there has been a tremendous increase in the awareness and activities of derivative securities. In particular there is a need to devise new techniques to address the limitations of traditional parametric pricing methods, which rely on assumptions and approximations to capture the complex dynamics of pricing processes. This paper proposes a novel non-parametric method using an ad-hoc recurrent neural network for estimating the future prices of war commodities such as gold and crude oil as well as currencies, which are increasingly gaining importance in the financial markets. The price predictions from the network, shown to be accurate and computationally efficient, are used in a hedging system to avoid unnecessary risks. Experiments with actual gold and currency trading data show that our system using the proposed network and strategy can construct portfolios yielding a return on investment of about 4.76\%.},

The stochastic time effective function represents that the recent information has a stronger effect for the investors than the old information. With the established model the empirical research has a good performance in testing the predictive effects on four different time series indices. Compared to other models, the present model is possible to evaluate data from 1990s to today with extreme accuracy and speedy.

	abstract = {For many years, fuel switching between natural gas and residual fuel oil kept natural gas prices closely aligned with those for crude oil. More recently, however, the number of U.S. facilities able to switch between natural gas and residual fuel oil has declined, and over the past seven years, U.S. natural gas prices have been on an upward trend with crude oil prices but with considerable independent movement. Natural gas market analysts generally emphasize weather and inventories as drivers of natural gas prices. Using an error-correction model, we show that when these and other additional factors are taken into account, movements in crude oil prices have a prominent role in shaping natural gas prices. Our findings imply a continuum of prices at which natural gas and petroleum products are substitutes.},
